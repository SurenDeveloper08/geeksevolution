    desc: "In 2028, the UAE will launch its interplanetary mission, with the primary goal of exploring the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The spacecraft will undertake a 3.6 billion-kilometre, five-year journey. Its final landing will be on an asteroid, 560 million kilometres from Earth in 2033. This will make the Emirates, the fourth nation to land a spacecraft on an asteroid.         ‘Make it in the Emirates’ is the unified industrial brand identity to encourage manufacturing and production in the UAE. Local and international investors are invited to contribute to the development of our national industries and promote with pride its uniqueness and super-quality.",
